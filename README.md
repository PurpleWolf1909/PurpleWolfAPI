The PurpleWolfAPI implements many events for event handlers from the Spigot and Paper API, along with a ton of custom ones and ones from other API's to make this API the most easy to use plugin for developers. It is also in association with the Origins-SpigotMC plugin(still in beta), with its own built in version of the API.
